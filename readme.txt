Inn Style WordPress Widget

== Description ==

Introducing the Inn Style WordPress Widget.

To take advantage of this widget, you must first create a FREE account at http://innstyle.co.uk

Once youâ€™re ready to take bookings, integration is blissfully simple with this widget.

Simply install the plugin as normal, and configure the type of widget (availability checker or calendar options are currently available) you want to embed into your Wordpress website.

The Inn Style Widget will adjust to the size of its container automatically, so you can be sure of minimal intervention from your web development team.

This is a first version for Inn Style HQ, so feedback is most welcome.

1. Upload the `inn-style-widget` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
